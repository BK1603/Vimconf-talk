- libUV `fs_events`
- Problems I faced:
  - Vim's weird file saving method
  - Multiple notifications
  - Issues I faced while working on old PRs
  - My own stupid mistakes
  - `uv_loop_close()` hangs
  - And probably a bunch of other stuff that do not remember exactly
- `fcnotify`, the option:
  - `off` don't watch
  - `autoread` for prompts
  - `watch` fs_event handle
  - `onfocus` the fallback
- Demo

- Supercool mentor
- Writing the code was super fun, except the part where it wasn't
- Constructive PR Reviews
- The community in general
- What did I learn?
- Will I contribute to the organisation in the future? (Psst, YES)

- You'll never learn enough before you think you can contribute.
- Start small:
  - Fix the documentation.
  - Fix a beginners bug.
- Let the community help you.
- How to choose an organisation?
  - Ideally, try contrbuting to something that you've been using.
  - Helps if you already have made contributions to that org earlier.
  - At least choose something that excites you.
- Research before you write your proposal.
- Leverage the community bonding period.
- Enjoy your work! :)

- You don't need to be an expert programmer.
- Programming isn't everything.
- Don't be afraid of asking questions and ask the right questions.
